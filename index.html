            <h2>Kong</h2>
            <p>
              Kong came from a traditional Asian family that valued introverted social habits. He was shy and timid, and this trait was a big stumbling block for him in his teenage years, as he lacked the confidence to approach not only girls, but people in general. It wasn’t until he stumbled on an online forum where guys shared dating advice — incidentally, this is how he met Jesse. Throughout the years he learned you can be introverted and yet still be very successful when picking up girls. Once Kong let go of his self-consciousness, he discovered how to have fun and be himself.

            <h2>Jesse</h2>
            <p>
              Jesse started out as an overweight, cake eating, anti-social computer gamer. In the hopes of getting a girlfriend, he motivated himself to eat healthier and exercise to lose his fat. This turned into a broader mission, as he started to improve his social skills by taking public speaking classes and pushing himself to talk to girls. Jesse didn’t wait around for his problems to disappear; he actively sought solutions and ways to improve his life. This is the philosophy he holds and teaches others today.

            <h2>Jason</h2>
            <p>
              Jason started talking to girls after his relationship of two years ended. He was so accustomed to girls asking him out that he had a difficult time pursuing and attracting girls he wanted to talk to. However, once he met and befriended Jesse and Kong, he soon realized that he had the choice to pick up any girl he bumped into. Jason was a quick learner, and has proven that all your limiting beliefs, from excuses to a fear of change, can be overcome.
